This file should contain description for reprepro's part

1) REPREPRO setup
As general reprepro guide i use (and i've written it) article http://mytechspam.livejournal.com/15066.html , you should do that things first.

example of distributions file for our hotfix repo:
root@repo:~# cat /srv/reprepro-hotfix/conf/distributions
Origin: squeeze-lamoda-hotfix
Label: Debian-All
Suite: squeeze-lamoda-hotfix
Codename: squeeze-lamoda-hotfix
Version: None
#NotAutomatic: yes
ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes
Architectures: i386 amd64 source
Components: main non-free contrib
Description: lamoda hotfix Debian Squeeze repository
SignWith: yes
UDebComponents: main
AlsoAcceptFor: unstable

I use /incoming/hotfix directory owned by uploader-dev:root , chmod 755 (750 is ok too). This directory should be set in .dput.cf from jenkins section of configuration docs.
Now, you have setup reprepro, incoming dir, dput uploads file and..and nothing happens. We should give birth of import magic.

2) IMPORT
To make packages be imported inside our repo, I've written another script and put it into crontab, like:
#crontab -l -u uploader-dev
*/2 * * * * /lamoda/scripts/import-packages.sh -D squeeze-lamoda-hotfix
where "squeeze-lamoda-hotfix" should match "Origin: squeeze-lamoda-hotfix" from reprepro distributions
to make uploads be a bit more interactive, I use incron, like:
#root@repo:~# incrontab -u uploader-dev -l
/incoming/hotfix IN_CREATE,IN_NO_LOOP /lamoda/scripts/import-packages.sh -D squeeze-lamoda-hotfix -S 15

This command will be fired on changes inside /incoming/hotfix , sleep 15 seconds to give time scp copy big files, and then begin to do import to reprepro.
The import script behaves in this way:
it starts, wait for some time if needed, then read _CONFIG_ file, sets lock,
processes incoming dir for *.changes file, parses that files, deletes
any packages found in that files from reprepro, just in case,
then adds .changes with reprepro's "include" command.
Usually this works well, but bad things may happen if you have bad habit
to generate packages with the same version, but different content - then
reprepro will curse you and refuse to import new packages. You may need
to delete them by hand/manual reprepro commands.

config file example:
#root@repo:~# cat /lamoda/scripts/configs/config.squeeze-lamoda-hotfix.cfg
CFG["incomingpath"]="/incoming/hotfix"
CFG["repreproroot"]="/srv/reprepro-hotfix"

Work is logged into syslog, so one may observe something like:
Sep 24 16:34:01 repo /USR/SBIN/CRON[21143]: (uploader-dev) CMD (/lamoda/scripts/import-packages.sh -D squeeze-lamoda-hotfix)
Sep 24 16:34:01 repo pkg-uploader: including config file /lamoda/scripts/configs/config.squeeze-lamoda-hotfix.cfg
Sep 24 16:34:01 repo pkg-uploader: processing /incoming/hotfix directory...
Sep 24 16:34:01 repo pkg-uploader: setting lockfile /tmp/uploader.squeeze-lamoda-hotfix.lock
Sep 24 16:34:01 repo pkg-uploader: removing package lamoda-prudsys-receiver
Sep 24 16:34:01 repo pkg-uploader: adding /incoming/hotfix/lamoda-frontend2.0_1.9.2.4-77-0b094f008b_amd64.changes into squeeze-lamoda-hotfix
Sep 24 16:34:02 repo pkg-uploader: removing lockfile /tmp/uploader.squeeze-lamoda-hotfix.lock


After this, packages are in repo. Go to server, do apt-get update && apt-get install lamoda-frontend2.0=1.9.2.4-77-0b094f008b and that's all.
